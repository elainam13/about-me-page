        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Elaina!</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>- Photography</h3>
    <p>I mostly take portraits and nature photos. I enjoy working with natural light and capturing moments that feel real.
        I take photos professionally from time to time, which is a different kind of challenge, but I enjoy it. Nature photography is more relaxed,
        It’s a hobby I’ve stuck with, but it’s also something I can turn into work when the opportunity arises.</p>
    <h3>- Land Cruiser</h3>
    <p>My first car was a 100 series Land Cruiser, and it’s still my favorite. I’ve always appreciated how reliable and capable it is,
        especially for off-roading. Exploring trails and rough terrain is one of my favorite ways to spend a weekend,
        and driving the Land Cruiser gives me the freedom to go places most cars can’t. It’s a car I’ve grown really attached to over the years.</p>
    <h3>- Puzzles</h3>
    <p>I spend a lot of my free time working on puzzles, especially in the summer or whenever I have downtime.
        I enjoy puzzles by Eric Dowdle because of the focus on National Parks and cities.
        It’s fun to see familiar places in a different way. Puzzles let me concentrate and take a break from screens,
        and I’m looking forward to getting back to them when I have more free time.</p>

    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>I’ve only traveled outside the country once, to Portugal, and it left a strong impression. I loved seeing the history and architecture up close,
        and the people we met were kind and welcoming. Within the U.S., I’ve visited over 10 states.
        Some of my favorite places so far are Seattle, Big Sky, New York, and DC. Each felt unique in its own way.</p>

    <h2>My top artists</h2>
    <h3>- Gracie Abrams</h3>
    <p>I first heard Gracie when she opened for Olivia Rodrigo's SOUR tour, and I've been a fan ever
    since. I've loved how her music has evolved over the years and I'm excited for what's to come.
    Some of my favorite songs include, <em>I Love you I'm sorry</em>, <em>Difficult</em>, and <em>I Told You Things</em>.</p>
    <h3>- Avery Anna</h3>
    <p>Avery Anna is actually a new addition to my list of favorites as I discovered her and her music
    this year. I've always loved country and she's an excellent storyteller. I was able to see her in concert
    this past month and it was magical. Some of my favorite songs include, <em>Wish You Well</em>, <em>It's Just Rainin'</em>,
        and <em>Restless Mind</em>.</p>
    <h3>- Noah Kahan</h3>
    <p>Noah Kahan will forever be in my music rotation. I've been listening to his work for a long time, and I love all of it.
    I was able to also see him in concert recently and he played some upcoming songs, all of which were amazing. A few of my
    favorites are <em>Maine</em>, <em>Forever</em>, and <em>A Troubled Mind</em>.</p>
